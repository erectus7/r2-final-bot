## üìÑ Configuration

The bot's configuration is divided into two parts: file setup and in-script setup.

### 1. File Setup

Create the following two files in the main project folder:

* **`private_keys.txt`**
    Fill it with all your wallet private keys, with each key on a new line.
    ```
    0xaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
    0xbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
    ```

* **`proxies.txt`** (Optional)
    If you want to use proxies, fill it with your HTTP proxies. The order of proxies must correspond to the order of private keys.
    ```
    http://user:pass@host:port
    http://user2:pass2@host2:port2
    ```

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING:** Never share or upload your `private_keys.txt` file anywhere, including public or private Git repositories. Use a `.gitignore` file to prevent it.

### 2. Script Setup

Open the main script file (`r2.js`) and find the `// --- CONFIGURATION ---` section. This is where you control the bot's behavior.

To enable or disable a feature, change the `ENABLED` value to `true` or `false`.

* `TRADE_BOT_CONFIG`: For trading cycles.
* `ASSET_ACQUISITION_CONFIG`: For buying assets.
* `LIQUIDITY_CONFIG`: For adding liquidity.
* `R2USD_STAKING_CONFIG`: For staking R2USD.
* `BTC_YIELD_CONFIG`: For depositing BTC Yield.

You can also change other parameters like `AMOUNT_TO_SWAP`, `JUMLAH_SIKLUS_TOTAL` (total cycle count), and others as needed.
